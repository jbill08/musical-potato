a console-based temperature and weight(mass) converter in Java

Lessons Learned
1. Method Decomposition
Splitting functionality into small methods (temperatureConverter, weightConverter) makes code reusable and easier to debug.

2. Switch Statements
Great for creating menu systems or handling multiple options.

3. User Input Handling
Using Scanner helps with reading input.

You need to handle invalid input cases (future improvement).

4. Loops
The do-while loop keeps the app running until the user exits.

5. Data Conversion
Practical understanding of math and real-life unit conversion formulas.

6. Modularity
This mini app can be extended (add distance, volume converters) with minimal code change.
